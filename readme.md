Zend Framework2 & Backbone Boilerplate
======================================

This boilerplate helps to get started with Zend Framework 2 and backbone. It is based 
on the original backbone-boilerplate project and adds an easy way to write
Zend Framework 2 apps.

Organize your application in a logical filesystem, develop your
Models/Collections/Views/Routers inside modules, and build knowing you have
efficient code that will not bottleneck your users.
